# Testing Guide for 3arida Platform

This guide covers how to test the 3arida petition platform locally and in different environments.

## üö® Current Testing Status

**Last Updated**: December 2024
**Testing Coverage**: ~40% Complete

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues Affecting Testing

1. **Authentication Error**: Iterator interface issue with Firebase Auth (undici library conflict)
   - Affects login/registration testing
   - Development server shows authentication errors
   - Workaround: Use Firebase emulators for testing

2. **Missing Test Implementation**: 
   - Unit tests not yet implemented
   - Integration tests need setup
   - E2E tests not configured

3. **Incomplete Features**:
   - Phone verification system not fully implemented
   - Payment integration (Stripe) not yet added
   - Real-time features partially implemented

### üîß Testing Priorities

1. Fix Firebase authentication issues
2. Set up basic unit test framework
3. Configure Firebase emulators for reliable testing
4. Implement integration tests for core features
5. Add E2E tests for critical user flows

## Prerequisites

Before testing, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js 18+** installed
2. **Firebase CLI** installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
3. **Dependencies** installed (`npm install`)
4. **Firebase Emulators** configured (recommended due to auth issues)

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd 3arida-app
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with your Firebase configuration:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=3arida

# Testing Configuration
NODE_ENV=test
```

### 3. Firebase Emulators (Recommended for Testing)

Start Firebase emulators for local testing:

```bash
# Start emulators
npm run firebase:emulators

# Or manually
firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,storage
```

This will start:

- **Authentication Emulator** on http://localhost:9099
- **Firestore Emulator** on http://localhost:8080
- **Storage Emulator** on http://localhost:9199

## Testing Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Test individual functions and components:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### 2. Integration Tests

Test Firebase operations and API integrations:

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests

Test complete user workflows:

```bash
# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### 4. Type Checking

Ensure TypeScript types are correct:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Firebase Connection Issues

If you get Firebase connection errors:

1. Check your `.env.local` file has correct values
2. Ensure Firebase project is properly configured
3. Try using Firebase emulators for local testing

### Authentication Issues

If authentication doesn't work:

1. Check Firebase Auth is enabled in console
2. Verify OAuth providers are configured
3. Check domain is added to authorized domains

### Phone Verification Issues

If phone verification fails:

1. Ensure reCAPTCHA is properly configured
2. Check phone number format (Moroccan numbers)
3. Verify Firebase Auth phone provider is enabled

### Build Issues

If the build fails:

1. Run `npm run type-check` to find TypeScript errors
2. Check all imports are correct
3. Ensure all required environment variables are set

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

Test the platform under load:

1. **Concurrent Users**: Test with multiple users signing petitions simultaneously
2. **Database Load**: Test with large numbers of petitions and signatures
3. **File Uploads**: Test multiple image uploads at once
4. **Real-time Updates**: Test with many concurrent signature updates

### Monitoring

Monitor key metrics:

- **Response Times**: API calls should be < 500ms
- **Database Queries**: Optimize slow queries
- **Storage Usage**: Monitor file upload sizes
- **Error Rates**: Keep error rates < 1%

## Deployment Testing

### Staging Environment

Before production deployment:

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run full test suite against staging
3. Test with real Firebase project (not emulators)
4. Verify all environment variables are correct
5. Test payment flows with Stripe test mode

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Review Firebase console for authentication/database issues
3. Check network tab for failed API calls
4. Review the logs in Firebase Functions (if using)
5. Consult the Firebase documentation for specific features
